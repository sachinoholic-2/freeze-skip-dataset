This repository contains a dataset and a Python script for generating frame skip and freeze analysis videos. The dataset includes sample images and a script to create videos that demonstrate frame skipping and freezing effects, with annotations and timestamps for analysis. The script generates 10 videos with varying configurations: 3 with only freeze effects, 5 with both freeze and skip effects, and 2 with only skip effects.

This repository contains a dataset and a Python script for generating frame skip and freeze analysis videos. The dataset includes sample images and a script to create videos that demonstrate frame skipping and freezing effects, with annotations and timestamps for analysis. The script generates 10 videos with varying configurations: 3 with only freeze effects, 5 with both freeze and skip effects, and 2 with only skip effects.
Features





Frame Skipping: Rapid transitions between images during specified intervals, marked with "FRAME SKIP" annotations.



Frame Freezing: Pauses on a single image for a specified duration, marked with "FREEZE (duration)" annotations.



Timestamps: Overlaid on each video frame for analysis.



Video Configurations:





Videos 1–3: 2 freeze points each, no skips.



Videos 4–8: 2 freeze points and 2 skip intervals each, with unique trigger times.



Videos 9–10: 2 skip intervals each, no freezes.



Each video is 10 seconds long at 30 FPS.
